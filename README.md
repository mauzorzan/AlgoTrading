# Portfolio Optimization Project
This project focuses on the optimization of a financial portfolio by calculating strategy returns based on specified dates and selected financial instruments. The core of the project involves data preprocessing, optimization of asset weights, and the calculation of weighted returns for defined periods. By leveraging historical data, the project aims to construct an optimal portfolio that maximizes returns while managing risk.

The process begins with the calculation of logarithmic returns of adjusted closing prices for the selected financial instruments. These returns serve as the foundation for further analysis and optimization. The project is structured to handle multiple start dates, provided in the fixed_dates dictionary, allowing for flexibility in backtesting different periods. For each start date, the script determines the corresponding end date and defines a 12-month optimization period leading up to the start date.

The optimization of portfolio weights is a critical step, where the project attempts to maximize the Sharpe ratioâ€”a measure of risk-adjusted return. If the optimization process fails for any reason, the project defaults to assigning equal weights to all instruments, ensuring that the analysis can continue without interruption. The weighted returns for each period are then calculated and aggregated, providing a comprehensive view of the strategy's performance over time.

By combining robust data processing techniques with sophisticated optimization algorithms, this project offers a powerful tool for financial analysts and portfolio managers seeking to enhance their investment strategies. The modular design and clear structure make it easy to adapt and extend the project for various use cases, including different asset classes and optimization criteria.
